Hi! I am a senior research machine learning engineer in the Microsoft Research - Health Futures. My work within the Biomedical Imaging group focuses on optimising radiology workflows using artificial intelligence.

Prior to joining Microsoft, I worked as a research engineer in the Centre for Neuroimaging Research at the Paris Brain Institute(opens in new tab). Then, I moved on to UCL and King’s College London for my PhD in Medical Imaging, where I investigated the potential of artificial intelligence to improve the treatment of epilepsy.

I am a strong supporter of open-source software, and a recurrent contributor to multiple open-source projects. When not staring at a computer screen, I can be found playing football or trumpet.
